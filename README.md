# JXA Filesystem

This is a simple JXA wrapper over a little confusing official API.
It provides basic functions to work with the filesystem like:

- read/write files
- list directory contents
- create files/directories

## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is intended to be used with JXA and built using [jxa-builder](https://github.com/seb0xff/jxa-builder)

```bash
npm i jxa-filesystem
```

```javascript
const fs = Library("jxa-filesystem");
...
```
